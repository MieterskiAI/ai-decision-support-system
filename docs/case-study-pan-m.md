# Case Study – Pan M.

This document presents a complete example of how the AI Decision Support System operates on a representative user profile.

The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate the system’s decision logic, not to evaluate the individual.

---

## User Profile Overview

**Identifier:** Pan M. (anonymized, representative user)

**Age:** 36  
**Background:** Non-technical / general  
**AI Exposure:** Basic user-level experience (e.g., ChatGPT, curiosity-driven exploration)

**Goal:**  
Identify a realistic and low-friction entry path into the AI field within a 6–12 month horizon.

## Diagnostic Input

### Module 1 – Context & Starting Point

- Limited formal technical background
- Comfortable with digital tools and systems
- No prior programming experience
- Motivation driven by career transition and market pressure

**Interpretation:**
- No immediate elimination signals
- Realistic starting point
- Constraints acknowledged early

---

### Module 2 – Cognitive & Work Style

- Preference for structured environments
- Enjoyment of organizing systems and workflows
- Functional creativity over open-ended exploration
- Discomfort with vague or subjective outcomes

**Interpretation:**
- Strong alignment with structured, operational paths
- Weak alignment with ambiguity-heavy roles

---

### Module 3 – Frustration & Abstraction Tolerance

- Accepts errors if causes are understandable
- Low tolerance for chaos without rules
- Prefers predictable feedback loops

**Interpretation:**
- Hard stop for paths requiring sustained ambiguity
- Risk signal for highly technical debugging-heavy paths

---

### Module 4 – Expectations & Resources

- Available time: ~6–8 hours per week
- Expected timeline: early sense of progress within 2–3 months
- Definition of success: confidence in direction and practical competence

**Interpretation:**
- Feasible for applied, operational paths
- Misalignment with paths requiring long upfront investment

---

## Path Elimination Process

### Eliminated Paths

**Prompt Engineering / AI Interaction Design**
- High ambiguity tolerance required
- Iterative, language-driven experimentation
- Misaligned with preference for structure

**AI Engineering (Light)**
- Early-stage technical frustration likely
- Debugging uncertainty exceeds tolerance threshold

**AI Consulting / Implementation**
- Premature without operational or domain experience
- Advisory responsibility too early in the transition

---

## Remaining Path

### Recommended Main Path

**AI Automation / AI Operations**

**Rationale:**
- Strong alignment with structured thinking
- Clear feedback loops
- Practical, observable outcomes
- Lower cognitive and emotional friction at entry level

This path does not require deep programming knowledge at the start and allows for incremental skill acquisition.

---

## Alternative Consideration (Future)

**AI Engineering (Light)**  
May become viable after:
- increased tolerance for technical uncertainty,
- foundational experience with system logic and integrations.

Not recommended as a starting point.

## Final Recommendation Summary

The system recommends **A**
