# Example Decision Report

This document presents an example output generated by the AI Decision Support System.

It illustrates the **final decision report** a user would receive after completing the diagnostic process.
The report is explanatory and reflective by design, not prescriptive.

## User Summary

**Profile ID:** Example User (anonymized)  
**Background:** Non-technical / semi-technical  
**Objective:** Identify a realistic entry path into AI within 6–12 months

This report reflects the user’s current context and inputs at the time of diagnosis.

---

## Interpreted Profile

Based on the diagnostic input, the system identified the following dominant characteristics:

- Preference for structured environments
- Motivation driven by practical outcomes rather than exploration
- Moderate tolerance for uncertainty when rules and feedback are clear
- Limited weekly time availability
- Desire for early validation rather than long-term abstraction

These characteristics guided the elimination process.

---

## Recommended Entry Path

### ✅ Primary Recommendation  
**AI Automation / AI Operations**

**Why this path was selected:**
- Strong alignment with structured problem-solving
- Clear cause–effect feedback loops
- Emphasis on systems, workflows, and reliability
- Lower cognitive friction at entry level
- Incremental learning curve with visible progress

This path allows the user to build confidence through applied work while gradually expanding technical depth.

---

## Alternative Consideration

### ⚠️ Conditional Alternative  
**AI Engineering (Light)**

This path may become viable in the future if:
- tolerance for technical ambiguity increases,
- foundational system logic is mastered,
- frustration thresholds shift through experience.

It is not recommended as an initial focus.

---

## Eliminated Paths and Rationale

### ❌ Prompt Engineering / AI Interaction Design
- Requires sustained comfort with ambiguity
- Relies heavily on subjective evaluation
- Misaligned with the user’s preference for structure and predictability

### ❌ AI Consulting / Implementation
- Requires advisory confidence and domain experience
- High responsibility early in the transition
- Better suited as a later-stage role

## 7-Day Starting Plan

The purpose of this plan is **fit validation**, not skill mastery.

**Day 1–2**
- Review basic concepts of workflow automation
- Explore common automation tools and patterns

**Day 3–4**
- Build a simple automation:
  - input → processing → output
- Focus on understanding logic flow, not optimization

**Day 5–6**
- Modify the automation:
  - add one conditional rule
  - introduce a small failure case

**Day 7**
- Reflect on:
  - engagement level,
  - frustration points,
  - sense of control and clarity

---

## What to Avoid at This Stage

- Avoid enrolling in multiple courses simultaneously
- Avoid deep specialization too early
- Avoid comparing progress to experienced practitioners

The goal is alignment, not acceleration.

---

## Confidence Level of Recommendation

**Moderate to High**, based on current inputs.

This recommendation is **context-dependent** and may evolve with experience.
Re-running the diagnostic after several weeks is encouraged.

---

## Final Note

This report is intended to support informed decision-making.
It does not predict outcomes and does not replace personal judgment.

Its value lies in reducing early-stage friction and preventing misaligned commitments.
